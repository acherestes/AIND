# Recurrent Neural Networks course project: time series prediction and text generation

The first part of this project takes as input historical data on Apple stocks and models a recursive function that predicts future values.
The second part of the model trains on Sherlock Holmes novels and learns to generate "Sherlock-Holmes-like" sentences.
